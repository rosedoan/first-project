            It always baffles me how most chocolate chip cookies have pretty
            much the same ingredients, but the results can vary greatly. My old
            go to recipe called for a box of pudding mix, but the long list of
            unpronounceable ingredients on the pudding box was unnerving enough
            that decided to look for another recipe. This was the third recipe I
            tried and I think my search is over. The results were perfect.
            Buttery, but tall. I think the dissolving of baking soda in water
            makes them stand taller than your typical cookie using all butter.
            Chewy in the middle, with crisp edges and the perfect amount of
            vanilla (if you use good quality extract). Mine had to bake for 13
            minutes, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.
            Everyone has a different idea of what a 'perfect' cookie is, but I
            absolutely can not see how someone could give this a bad review (one
            or two stars) if they followed the recipe. Thanks for the recipe!

            I've tried a lot of different chocolate chip cookie recipes and this
            is the best one by far! They weren't too cake-like and they weren't
            thin and greasy, they were the perfect in-between cookie. That said,
            the dough is very thick once you mix all the ingredients together. A
            bit of advice - if you like a thinner cookie and not so cake-like,
            make a smaller ball of dough and when you place it on the cookie
            sheet be sure to flatten it quite a bit as the dough doesn't seem to
            spread when in the oven. If you like thick cookies, just leave them
            in the ball and they'll stay big. As the recipe states, they are
            crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside - still nice and moist
            the following day. I added some Skor toffee bits to the recipe and
            they turned out amazing - will definitely make again!! Thanks for
            sharing.

            These cookies are life-changing! The best I've ever tasted in 25
            years of baking. They have the right balance of flavor and texture.
            HERE'S A FEW TIPS TO GUARANTEE PERFECTION: 1. Replace 1 to 1 1/2
            cups all-purpose flour with oatmeal flour (oatmeal that's been
            processed until powder). 2. Take cookies out of the oven before they
            appear fully cooked, and let them stay on the cookie sheet for at
            least ten minutes. Cookies allowed to cool on the cookie sheet are
            much chewier. 3. I find dissolving the baking soda in water is
            unneccesary, they come out perfect regardless though I still added
            the spoon of hot water. 4. Use salted butter in this recipe in
            addition to the salt called for. 5. This dough freezes well. I
            double it, roll half into one-inch balls then freeze so I can have
            ready made cookie dough balls to bake another time.
